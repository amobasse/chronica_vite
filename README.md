# Chronica

Chronica is a web application to aid in running Dungeons and Dragons games, and to act as a vault for characters that can be browsed, viewed, and edited, somewhat like Facebook.

Users will be able to create an account, and then log in and create profiles for their D&D characters. These characters can then plug in to various sub systems involved in various campaigns, automating the tracking using them.
